                                      Visi.js does not have a specific release cycle but follows a rolling release model. This means that new features are added as soon as they are ready and tested.

                                      Below you can find the different release types and what they mean.

                                        Canary releases are new implementations that we will not  guarantee to be stable. They are released to get feedback from the community and to test new features.

                                           - Beta releases are semi stable releases that are ready for production but may have some bugs. We will try to fix these bugs as soon as possible.
