# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Visijs does not support older versions they will not be updated after release.
As of 6/11/23 all new versions will be set under a revision ruleset - which means we will support updates to a single version up to 5 months!
We did not do this before because new versions often fix what older versions lack.

| Version | Supported          |
